# Mmm-Eat in the Middle 
Coding Bootcamp Project 1

Our application is called Mmm-eat in the middle and this application was built so we can find a middle point in between two locations for two people that are planning to meet. With this middle point we can provide some restaurants around the area to meet at. 

# Motivation

We wanted to build this because we wanted to help people find restaurants to eat at in an area at the midpoint.
